<br>I made sure that when the planner was opened, the current day displayed at the top of the calendar.</br>
<br>I added addition rows so that when I scrolled down, it presented time blocks from 12:00 pm to 5:00 pm.</br>
<br>I changed classes so that time block is color coded to indicate past, present, or future and that they were the same size.</br>
<br>I made sure that you can click into the timeblocks in order to enter an event.</br>
<br>I made sure that when you click the save button for the time block that you enter text in, that it gets saved to the local storage.</br>
<br>I made sure that when I refresh the page, then the saved events persist.</br>
